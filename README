Two versions of the code are built. One uses standard copy of host
data to the GPU memory. The other does memory mapping since the GPU
and CPU share DDR memory on this host. The versions are differentiated
by the compiler flag -DZEROCOPY

To build with minimal output:

make

To build with debug output:

make CFLAGS=-DDEBUG

To initialize arrays to the index value instead of a random number:

make CFLAGS=-DNORANDOM

To clean up, do either 

make clean

or 

make veryclean
